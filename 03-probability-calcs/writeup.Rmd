1. What is the probability that the Braves win the World Series given that `P(B)= 0.55`?

```{r}
pnbinom(3,4,0.55)
```

2. What is the probability that the Braves win the World Series given that `P(B)=x`? This will be a figure (see below) with PB on the x-axis and P(Braves win World Series) on the y-axis.

```{r}
vec <- seq(0.5,1.0,0.01)
prob <- pnbinom(3,4, vec)
new_df <- data.frame(winning = vec, probability = prob)
new_df
```
