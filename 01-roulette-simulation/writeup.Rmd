# Introduction

Martingale's Strategy is an approach that some have deemed as a foolproof way to play roulette. Therefore, it has to be evaluated from a statistical viewpoint to justify its flawlessness. A computer simulation was built to run numerous trials of the Martingale's strategy in roulette to see how well it performs based on average earnings and average winnings. The simulation should also be explored to see what would happen if certain variables were adjusted. For instance, if the number of trials were increased or reduced or if the budget and the budget threshold values were adjusted. Another interesting inquiry is to know a player's financial condition after a certain number of wagers.

## Background

A roulette wheel has 18 red pockets, 18 black pockets and 2 green pockets. Each pocket is designed using the same dimension. Hence, there is an equal chance of landing on any pocket. If a player places a wager (or a bet) in the form of money on whether the black or red pocket will be selected and that same pocket is selected, the player gets his equivalent amount of wager as earnings. In the case of the player's pocket not being selected, the player loses all their waged money. The Martingale's strategy requires the player to keep waging twice the amount of money waged in the previous play in order to ensure a win in the long run. For example, if I wage a bet of 10 dollars and I lose, I will need to place a bet of 20 dollars in my next try. The computer simulation needs to incorporate variables such as budget, maximum number of plays, budget limit and maximum profit. All these variables will be crucial towards simulating Martingale's strategy in action. According to our experiment, the player will have 200 dollars as his budget, and he will be allowed to play for a maximum number of 1000 plays or until he loses all his money. The player will also be made to stop if his earnings are reported to be over or equal to +100 dollars. Thereby, establishing a budget limit of 300 dollars. The simulation is set up to be repeated a certain number of trials. The final budget made for each trial is recorded, and 200 dollars is subtracted from each final budget to obtain their earnings. Then, the average earning is calculated by dividing the sum of all the earnings by the number of trials. The code that was used to create the simulation can be seen in the methods section below:

# Methods

```{r}
#' A single play of the Martingale strategy
#'
#' Takes a state list, spins the roulette wheel, returns the state list with updated values (for example, budget, plays, etc)
#' @param state A list with the following entries: 
#'   B              number, the budget
#'   W              number, the budget threshold for successfully stoping
#'   L              number, the maximum number of plays 
#'   M              number, the casino wager limit
#'   plays          integer, the number of plays executed
#'   previous_wager number, the wager in the previous play (0 at first play)
#'   previous_win   TRUE/FALSE, indicator if the previous play was a win (TRUE at first play)
#' @return The updated state list
one_play <- function(state){
  
    # Wager
    proposed_wager <- ifelse(state$previous_win, 1, 2*state$previous_wager)
    wager <- min(proposed_wager, state$M, state$B)
    
    # Spin of the wheel
    red <- rbinom(1,1,18/38)
    
    # Update state
    state$plays <- state$plays + 1
    state$previous_wager <- wager
    if(red){
      # WIN
      state$B <- state$B + wager
      state$previous_win <- TRUE
    }else{
      # LOSE
      state$B <- state$B - wager
      state$previous_win <- FALSE
    }
  state
}


#' Stopping rule
#'
#' Takes the state list and determines if the gambler has to stop
#' @param state A list.  See one_play
#' @return TRUE/FALSE
stop_play <- function(state){
  if(state$B <= 0) return(TRUE)
  if(state$plays >= state$L) return(TRUE)
  if(state$B >= state$W) return(TRUE)
  FALSE
}


#' Play roulette to either bankruptcy, success, or play limits
#'
#' @param B number, the starting budget
#' @param W number, the budget threshold for successfully stoping
#' @param L number, the maximum number of plays 
#' @param M number, the casino wager limit
#' @return A vector of budget values calculated after each play.

  # vector to store budget over series of plays

  # For loop of plays
  for(i in 1:L){
    new_state <- state %>% one_play
    budget[i] <- new_state$B

# Walk out money distribution

mean(walk_out_money > 200)

# Estimated earnings

```

# Results

## Earning vs Play Sample

```{r}
# Earnings
earning = one_series(B = 200, W = 300, L = 1000, M = 100) - 200
x = 1:length(earning)
new_df <- data.frame(x = x, earning = earning)
ggplot(new_df) + geom_line(aes(x = x, y = earning), color = 'blue') + labs(title = "A typical example of a roulette round", x = "play number") + theme_bw()
```


## Tweaking the simulation's parameters

```{r}
# Simulation
walk_out_money <- rep(NA, 5000)
for(j in seq_along(walk_out_money)){
  walk_out_money[j] <- one_series(B = 200, W = 300, L = 1000, M = 100) %>% get_last
}

# Walk out money distribution
hist(walk_out_money, breaks = 100)

# Estimated probability of walking out with extra cash
mean(walk_out_money > 200)

# Estimated earnings
mean(walk_out_money - 200)

# Simulation
walk_out_money2 <- rep(NA, 15000)
for(j in seq_along(walk_out_money2)){
  walk_out_money2[j] <- one_series(B = 200, W = 300, L = 1000, M = 100) %>% get_last
}

# Walk out money distribution
hist(walk_out_money2, breaks = 100)

# Estimated probability of walking out with extra cash
mean(walk_out_money2 > 200)

# Estimated earnings
mean(walk_out_money2 - 200)
```
